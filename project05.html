	<h1> Our Mission </h1>
	<p1> Food and Water Watch champions healthy food and clean water for all. We stand up to corporations that put profits before people, and advocate for a democracy that improves people’s lives and protects our environment. </p1>
	
	<h1 class="clear"> Our Values </h1>
	<h3> Independence </h3>
		<p> We are a public interest organization that remains independent of corporate and government influence. We are funded fully through our members, individual donors, and foundation grants. </p>
	<h3> Democracy </h3>
		<p> We engage and mobilize citizens politically through person-to-person, on-the-ground organizing, educational campaigns and new media technologies. We believe political involvement is critical for holding governments accountable to their constituents and for creating policies that ensure a sustainable world with safe food and clean water. </p>
	<h3> Human Rights </h3>
		<p> Although food and water are human rights, the political will to ensure that all people have adequate nutrition and drinking water is lacking. We are part of the growing global movement fighting this injustice. </p>
	<h3> Sustainability </h3>
		<p> We believe in a sustainable future — one that ensures access to essential resources for future generations while protecting the quality of our environment.</p>

	<h1> Clean Water is a Human Right!</h1>
	<p> Clean drinking water is a human right, but even in the United States, people have to worry about whether their water is safe to drink, and whether they can afford it. This IS a problem we can solve! We need dedicated funding to keep our water systems up to date and affordable to protect our drinking water for generations to come. </p>
